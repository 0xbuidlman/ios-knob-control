    * Version 1.1.0

    Can now choose from three gestures for the control.

    Control now functions without an externally supplied image. If no image supplied,
    the control provides a simple, customizable knob image.

    Numerous changes to the demo app:
    - Separate demos in a tab view for greater clarity: Continuous, discrete and feedback.
    - Feedback demo provides an example of using a disabled knob control as a dial.
    - New knob images.
    - Demos of new built-in knob images and gestures.

    * Version 1.2.0
    
    Rotary dial mode complete.

    Added support for using a tap gesture in all modes.

    Control now has backgroundImage and foregroundImage properties. These properties may be used
    to specify stationary background and foreground layers for the control. The knob image rotates
    between them. These are particularly useful for providing a dial background with numbers and
    a finger stop in the foreground in rotary dial mode, but they are available in all modes.

    Demo app:
    - Rotary dial demo with some poor images (as well as generated dial images).
    - Tap gesture option available in continuous and discrete demos.
